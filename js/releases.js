			description: [
				'"Kar Pouzi is Helen Papaioannou\'s solo project of baritone saxophone and electronics. In tides of pulses, ecstatic drones and churning bass, Red Sprite is Kar Pouzi’s debut EP release, brought to you by don’t drone alone. Red Sprite takes an unadorned approach to the baritone sax, revelling in incessant repetitions that converge and contrast with the sounds of sampled analogue synths. Undulating rhythms knit together layers of electronics, building heaving waves of pulses that loom and subside." - Kar Pouzi'

			artist: 'MG Dysfunction',
			title: 'Complete Deletion',
			description: [
				'"Hi. I’m Fred, a music-maker from Leeds. Generally I go by Fred M-G but sometimes I make work under the name of M-G Dysfunction. My new album Complete Deletion is an M-G Dysfunction affair and it’s being released by don\'t drone alone.',
				'I hate M-G Dysfunction. I hate the sentiments that I express there and I hate the demons that I face when I make this stuff. I hate the project’s whole pseudo-intellectual anti-music schtick. It is dysfunctional music that comes from dysfunctional parts of my personality. I’d much rather I didn’t have to engage with these sides of myself and that I could just get on with living my life in a relatively uncomplicated way.',
				'But they are there, so I have to deal with them. Complete Deletion is what emerged from a couple of years in my mid-20s when I was often at war with myself. I think hyperbolic statements like ‘I was at war with myself’ are stupid but I feel compelled to use one here - another example of M-G Dysfunction making me look like an idiot.',
				'I look back on the period that spawned Complete Deletion as a bit of a lost time, one of enervation and self-sabotage. Those who purchase copies of the cassette will find a poem on the inside of the cover which narrows down how I felt in those moments.',
				'I began making these tracks by turning up the speed on my drum machine until it started to produce drones. I then chopped up those drones and interspersed them with other instrumentation - synths, cello, records played on a broken turntable which I sped up and slowed down by hand, a little guitar, a space echo pedal - which I also edited, re-sampled and ran through various Ableton plug-ins. There are bits of spoken word/poetry on the record too, and also a bit of singing that I recorded when a choir were singing in a park opposite my house one day. I don’t know how I’d go about finding the choir again but if I track them down in future I’ll let you know who it is so they can get their credit.',
				'I think that Complete Deletion sounds like Rainforest Spiritual Enslavement and Radiante Pourpre and, if you squint, Sunn O))). Robin from don\'t drone alone says that it reminds him of Carl Stone."'

			artist: 'TAYSTII',
			title: 'Clangistan X',
			description: [
				'Clangistan has grown up with TAYSTII, both chronicling and side-stepping his progress on the decks. The project has swerved through emotional terrain, with different episodes considering music as a metaphor for pressure, a vessel for humour, and a survey of violence.', 
				'(true – clangistan is a place that fosters unexpected alchemies and fascinating mutations. that said, it doesn’t necessarily involve *growing up* so much as it does *spiralling off into some vague direction somewhere*)', 
				'The genres have changed, but TAYSTII’s approach - to harmonise on the corners of sound that never meet - has remained the same. In his own words: ‘unnatural phalanxes and bottled spontaneity, chaotic as the river that flows’.', 
				'(also true, those are my own words. on side a, you’ll find Clangistan X, supposedly the tenth iteration of this approach. it sandwiches a spread of artists who would make for a great dinner party; there are classic club cuts, slivers of hip-hop, slices of techno, indie thins, layered riddims, hell, one of the tracks is called ‘i want to eat you’. plenty of sounds that are all great to tayst, and seem to make a lot of sense sequenced together when dined on in clangistan)', 
				'In another world we’d be billing TAYSTII as our favourite From Soft speedrunner. Given the chance to make a b-side, he’s served up a slice of aural fandom for Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.', 
				'(unfortunately i’m more likely to start loads of new games rather than complete an actual run. the rhythm and musicality of its arcade-style combat is unrivalled)', 
				'With Sekiro In Clangistan, he blends together songs as sound effects, recreating palpable in-game sensations: perpetual movement and hyper-speed precision shine through the mix, played up through the metallic clashing of swords. With this breathless b-side, TAYSTII links mixing to Sekiro’s exhaustive shinobi combat, soaking up pressure only to parry and break posture.', 
				'(sekiro is a masterpiece. Sekiro In Clangistan is, well, also a piece. as you spend time with its aesthetics, consider the cycle of birth, death and rebirth our hero is caught in. a melancholic longing for freedom, a struggle to reconcile it against honour-bound duties and a determination that sits in the heart of all adventurers – they’re all present here)'

			artist: 'talbot fade',
			title: 'my voice would reach you',
			description: [
				'My Voice Would Reach You is the third album by Talbot Fade, made with love and warmth for Don\'t Drone Alone. Borrowing its name from a short and quietly traumatising video installation by artist Meiro Koizumi, it is a deeply personal exploration of grief, acceptance, dreams, maternal influence and communication across astral planes. It was written in the year following the passing of the artist\'s mother, and while ultimately still created as a collection of comforting music, it doesn\'t shy away from confronting and even embracing the sheer nightmarish horror of the abyss orphans find themselves in the aftermath of such immediate and staggering loss.', 
				'Influenced by music from his mother\'s music collection, alongside his usual comforts found in the darkest depths of roleplaying games, great bodies of water and flickering, fading embers, My Voice Would Reach You sees Talbot Fade at his most fragile, but also at his most inspired. A collection of four lengthy meditations that channel love, care, gratitude and solace into messages that seek to transcend dreams, nightmares and the waking world, ushering lost souls into a new childhood.'

			artist: 'chrissie',
			title: 'from the carboniferous',
			description: [
				'in her own words:', 
				'"Chrissie Caulfield was born at a very young age and was obviously going to be a musician as she started playing Beatles songs on an out-of-tune guitar before she was 5. Oh actually no, everyone did that. Her musical career took off when she discovered that with sufficient amplification and and inordinate amount of effects pedals, a violin could actually make interesting noises without all that tedious messing about with conservatoire training."', 
				'this is all in keeping with the vague non-rules and amplification adoration of the dda collective, and we welcome the release of her tape \'from the carboniferous\'. sided with a thirty minute, one-take drone of sounds both gorgeous and stupefying. inspired in part by a quarry in Horsforth, with the resonating contours to boot, the piece ripples with a kind of yorkshire sci-fi. flipped over the tape becomes an immense sound montage called "seeing through walls".'

			artist: 'hardworking families',
			title: 'worse than a stranger',
			description: [
				'hardworking families is the project of one noise boy called tom bench. a living venn-diagram of brighton and leeds, tom used to tell anyone who would listen about his favourite abstract music; now he eagerly creates it, developing different sounds, characters and aesthetics inspired by what he loves and what he can’t stand. in performance, he has critiqued the transgressions of power electronics and acted out jokes about indie rock clichés – he has also misunderstood the telos of chairs and stapled reverse contact mics to television sets playing reruns of scrubs. here he is, though, alive and droning: Worse Than A Stranger sees tom stretch out for two longform pieces on two very different hypes.', 
				'on side a of what he would tell you is a ‘45rpm cassette’, tom walks downstairs to pre-established feedback and starts tinkering, the sounds of the house’s creaking floorboards entwining with growling delay. the drone eventually distances itself from tom as his no-input mixer starts to actualise – it breathes in bitter rhythms, eventually spitting them out like bad medicine. our tenacious artist eventually worms his way back in, gently dovetailing the drone, and finally using one of his classic trash instruments – a bike bell without the bike – to ring out a final suite.', 
				'the textural rawness of “Byantwood Road, Washington street” is pretty gruelling, though tom would probably give you his most surprised ‘oh?’ face if you told him so. he offsets it with “Paternoster”, a quiet and fertile piece of sound. recorded in sheffield university’s arts tower, a building constructed with an open compartment elevator, the piece shifts through wobbly strands of everyday life; it absorbs fragmented conversations and shuffles through the sounds of people hurrying off to their academic pursuits. tom makes the rushed, anxious movements sound merely figurative – they’re somehow slower and more dreamlike in this recorded format, creaking with kindness. the piece resolves on the sound of tom somewhere else, tapping at a printer on further travels through yorkshire’s loveliest city.', 
				'someone buy him some real instruments, am i right?'
