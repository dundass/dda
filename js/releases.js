			title: 'worse than a stranger',
			description: ['hardworking families is the project of one noise boy called tom bench. a living venn-diagram of brighton and leeds, tom used to tell anyone who would listen about his favourite abstract music; now he eagerly creates it, developing different sounds, characters and aesthetics inspired by what he loves and what he can’t stand. in performance, he has critiqued the transgressions of power electronics and acted out jokes about indie rock clichés – he has also misunderstood the telos of chairs and stapled reverse contact mics to television sets playing reruns of scrubs. here he is, though, alive and droning: Worse Than A Stranger sees tom stretch out for two longform pieces on two very different hypes.', 'on side a of what he would tell you is a ‘45rpm cassette’, tom walks downstairs to pre-established feedback and starts tinkering, the sounds of the house’s creaking floorboards entwining with growling delay. the drone eventually distances itself from tom as his no-input mixer starts to actualise – it breathes in bitter rhythms, eventually spitting them out like bad medicine. our tenacious artist eventually worms his way back in, gently dovetailing the drone, and finally using one of his classic trash instruments – a bike bell without the bike – to ring out a final suite.', 'the textural rawness of “Byantwood Road, Washington street” is pretty gruelling, though tom would probably give you his most surprised ‘oh?’ face if you told him so. he offsets it with “Paternoster”, a quiet and fertile piece of sound. recorded in sheffield university’s arts tower, a building constructed with an open compartment elevator, the piece shifts through wobbly strands of everyday life; it absorbs fragmented conversations and shuffles through the sounds of people hurrying off to their academic pursuits. tom makes the rushed, anxious movements sound merely figurative – they’re somehow slower and more dreamlike in this recorded format, creaking with kindness. the piece resolves on the sound of tom somewhere else, tapping at a printer on further travels through yorkshire’s loveliest city.', 'someone buy him some real instruments, am i right?'],

			artist: 'sad_rave',
			title: 'add red',
			description: ['the irreplaceable sad_rave follows the instructions of michael pisaro\'s "add red" score to create a medley of shifting mass drone that\'s often cosy. he plays off sound and silence like dots and dashes, and sometimes just hangs out in the club with people who like to talk in spaces where they can\'t be heard.', 'backed with "one of those days (sad_red 3 organ mix)", a partial cover of the seany mac original of the same name.'],

			artist: 'chrissie',
			title: 'from the carboniferous',
			description: ['in her own words:', '"Chrissie Caulfield was born at a very young age and was obviously going to be a musician as she started playing Beatles songs on an out-of-tune guitar before she was 5. Oh actually no, everyone did that. Her musical career took off when she discovered that with sufficient amplification and and inordinate amount of effects pedals, a violin could actually make interesting noises without all that tedious messing about with conservatoire training."', 'this is all in keeping with the vague non-rules and amplification adoration of the dda collective, and we welcome the release of her tape \'from the carboniferous\'. sided with a thirty minute, one-take drone of sounds both gorgeous and stupefying. inspired in part by a quarry in Horsforth, with the resonating contours to boot, the piece ripples with a kind of yorkshire sci-fi. flipped over the tape becomes an immense sound montage called "seeing through walls".'],

			artist: 'talbot fade',
			title: 'my voice would reach you',
			description: ['My Voice Would Reach You is the third album by Talbot Fade, made with love and warmth for Don\'t Drone Alone. Borrowing its name from a short and quietly traumatising video installation by artist Meiro Koizumi, it is a deeply personal exploration of grief, acceptance, dreams, maternal influence and communication across astral planes. It was written in the year following the passing of the artist\'s mother, and while ultimately still created as a collection of comforting music, it doesn\'t shy away from confronting and even embracing the sheer nightmarish horror of the abyss orphans find themselves in the aftermath of such immediate and staggering loss.', 'Influenced by music from his mother\'s music collection, alongside his usual comforts found in the darkest depths of roleplaying games, great bodies of water and flickering, fading embers, My Voice Would Reach You sees Talbot Fade at his most fragile, but also at his most inspired. A collection of four lengthy meditations that channel love, care, gratitude and solace into messages that seek to transcend dreams, nightmares and the waking world, ushering lost souls into a new childhood.'],
